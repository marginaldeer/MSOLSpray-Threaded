# MSOLSpray-Threaded
This is a combination of MartinIngesen's MSOLSpray (https://github.com/MartinIngesen/MSOLSpray) and byt3bl33d3r's threaded port (https://gist.github.com/byt3bl33d3r/19a48fff8fdc34cc1dd1f1d2807e1b7f) coincidently this is all original work of DaftHack(https://github.com/dafthack/MSOLSpray). I barely modified much of anything so all credit goes to them. 

This script will perform password spraying against Microsoft Online accounts (Azure/O365). The script logs if a user cred is valid, if MFA is enabled on the account, if a tenant doesn't exist, if a user doesn't exist, if the account is locked, or if the account is disabled.
